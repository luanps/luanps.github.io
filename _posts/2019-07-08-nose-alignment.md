***Abstract**:*
Face alignment consists of accurately locating facial landmarks,
assisting in tasks such face 3D reconstruction,
recognition and expression analysis.
For this end, near frontal faces are extensively addressed by 2D landmark estimation approaches.
However, these methods suffer from lack of information in near profile head poses,
since popular datasets do not cover large head poses.
Recently, 3D face alignment was introduced, enabling the facial shape to be recovered in 3D space,
where profile faces are not a limitation.
In this work, we propose a method for unconstrained 3D face alignment
assisted by nose pose estimation,
enabling faces to be aligned in range of head poses with great reliability.
