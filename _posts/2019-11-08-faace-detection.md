***Abstract**:*
Face detection is a fundamental step for any face analysis approach.
However, it remains as an unsolved problem in computer vision,
specially, when it comes to the variability and distractions of
in-the-wild environments.
Moreover, a face detector must be accurate and fast to be
used in surveillance/biometrics scenarios.
In order to overcome these limitations, this paper proposes
a customized version of the state-of-the-art 
object detector, YOLOv3, for face detection.
The modifications aim at building a real-time, accurate
model capable of detecting faces as small as 16 pixels
in 34 FPS.
Furthermore, this model was evaluated on three of the
most difficult benchmarks for face detection, 
Wider Faces, UCCS and UFDD,
showing a good score balance across them.
Also, the comparison with the state-of-the-art
shown that it was possible to achieve the
second best FPS and the fifth best score
on Wider Faces.
Finally, the model will be available in
